### Problem 3.2. A famous simple interview question.

This problem is a famous programming job interview question designed to filter out those who think they can program but in reality can't. If you can easily solve this problem, you are already better than 99% of job candidates who apply for a programming job. The problem statement is simple:

- Print every number from 1 to 100.
- If the number is a multiple of 4, print "info" instead.
- If the number is a multiple of 6, print "matics" instead.
- If the number is a multiple of 4 _and_ 6, print "informatics" instead.

Note the spelling of "info**r**matics". There's an R in informatics.

- Use the template [print100.ipynb](https://github.com/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week03/print100.ipynb).

- Use conditionals and `str()` function to write a function named `get_informatics()` that takes an integer and returns a string. I emphasize that the return value is of type `str`, not `int`.

- Next, use `for` loop(s) and `get_informatics()` function to write a function named `print100()` that prints every number from 1 to 100.

- When you execute `print_informatics()`, your output should be
